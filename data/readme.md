Raw data for "Bounds as blueprints: towards optimal and accelerated photonic inverse design" 
by Chao, P.*, Amaolo, A.*, Molesky, S., & Rodriguez, A. W. 

/Lscaling: txt files containing the data for Fig 2a. First column is L, 2nd column is LDOS enhnacement, for global, local, scraped, and standard TO, as well as bounds. 
/iteration_curves: npy files containing the data for Fig 2b. Contain ldos enhancement as a function of iteration during topology optimization for global, local, scraped, and standard TO. 
/structures: strcutures as shown in Fig 2c. Square array npy files containing the structures for global, local, scraped, and standard TO linear interpolation variable, where rho=1 corresponds to chi=5+1e-4j, rho=0 corresponds to chi=0. Also contains optimal ring resonator widths as a function of L. 
/field_cut: txt files containing the data for Fig 3. First column is the length along the cross-cut, 2nd column is |E|^2.
